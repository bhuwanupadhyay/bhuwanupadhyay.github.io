In software development, the vast majority of the bugs are the consequence of the vague stories and uneven verification of the user acceptance criteria. To lessen such bugs, the idea of "Definition of Ready (DoR)" and "Definition of Done (DoD)" is exercised in a scrum. Furthermore, DoR and DoD are methods for approving work done in agile practice based on rules set by the team for DoR/DoD. Likewise, they are frequently known as an "agile best practice".

## Definition of Ready (DoR):  Is ready to build?

> **Definition of Ready**, or DOR, is a set of criteria that must be satisfied in order for an Epic or a Story to be accepted by the team. The story should be instantly "actionable," and ready to build. This happens BEFORE you build it, so you can think of this as "pre-validation." - quora

Ok! but what are the quality of a good story? For this widely used method is **INVEST** acronym in agile, coined by Bill Wake in his [article](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/).

The good story should be:

-   **I**  – Independent
-   **N**  – Negotiable
-   **V**  – Valuable
-   **E**  – Estimable
-   **S**  – Small
-   **T**  – Testable

## Definition of Done (DoD) :  Is ready to release?

> **Definition of Done**, or DOD, is the team’s agreement on what it means to complete a story. This happens AFTER you build it, so you can think of it as "post-validation." - quora

"Done" in an agile practice means **"no more work needs to be done before shipping"**.

## Conclusion
DoR/DoD are important concepts in agile development, they help to reduce the number of bugs in production and empower the team with a common checklist to validate their work to consider tasks is really "done for PO (DoR)" and "done for Developers (DoD)".
